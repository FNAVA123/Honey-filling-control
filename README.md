The project represents the simulation of an oil mixer and dispenser, within which there are three actuators and three physical variables. The three mentioned actuators are: a direct current motor, which will simulate the motor responsible for mixing the oil, a servo, responsible for opening and closing the flow valve for filling the bottles, and an LED module with traffic light colors. This will serve as a pilot light, where the green color indicates that the process is running, the amber color indicates that the process is in Stand By with the motor on, and the red color indicates that the process is stopped.
